# ðŸ’» DevOps Mac OS automated setup

This Ansible playbook installs and sets up most of the software and utilities for my DevOps environment.

## ðŸš¥ Installation

First of all clone or download this repository on your mac.

After that, you need to do some things to install prerequisites.
You can simply run the [install.sh](install.sh) script which includes all commands for the installation prerequisites.

_Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to XCode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run brew doctor to see if this is the case._

I clone my **dotfiles** repo (`.zshrc`, `.aliases`, `.gitignore_global`, etc.) to enable some options and set up aliases, etc.

Of course, you can use yours by changing the `dotfiles_repo` variable in `default.config.yml` file.

## ðŸš€ Usage

Edit `default.config.yml` to customize the list of software to install
and just run the following command at the root of this project and enter your account password when prompted.

```sh
ansible-playbook setup-my-mac.yml -i inventory -K
```

## âœ¨What this playbook do

The complete list of software installed is in `default.config.yml` , but in summary, here is what the playbook does.

- Install homebrew and cask and install applications, utilities and QuickLook plugins.
  (e.g. Docker, Terraform, Kubectl, slack, 1password, postman,...)
